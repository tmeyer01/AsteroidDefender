## Asteroid defender

Last year when I got back into coding I took a course at a local Community Collage. For our final project we asked to create video game inside a Canvas element using JS. 

At the time had never used any VCS, so this code was never uploaded anywhere.

When I stumbled upon the code today, it was great to look over and see how far ive come on my coding journey.  Wish I had started this project on github. As it would be great to look over commit history because I remember this being one heck of a learning process to say the least.
